# GRAPH THEORY

A graph is a set of vertices and edges connecting them.

## Terminology

**Incident**: `x` is incident to `a` and `b`.  
**Adjacenct**: `b` is adjacent to `a`,`c`,`e`. `a` is adjacent to `b`.  
**Isolated**: `d` is isolated.

## Types of graphs

1. **Undirected**:

   In an undirected graph, there is no direction in which the edges are pointing i.e. path from `a` to `b` is same as path from `b` to `a`.
2. **Directed**:

   In a directed graph, there is a direction in which the edges are pointing i.e. path from `a` to `b` is **not** same as path from `b` to `a`.
